``gitflow-wotw`` has grand aspirations to be ``gitflow-avh`` in Python using ``pygit2``.

Suggested Reading
=================

* The original `git flow article <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_
* |gitflow|_ (seriously outdated)
* |gitflow_avh|_ (highly recommended)
* |pygit2|_ (very useful)
* `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ (it makes so much sense)

.. code:: shell-session

    $ pip install --user gitflow-wotw

Roadmap
=======

These percentages are pretty arbitrary. Today's 47% could be tomorrow's 90% or vice versa.

Main Features
-------------

Once all of these are finished, I'll release ``v1``. Until then, ``v0`` should be used with caution, because it's not stable.

Eventual Features
-----------------

These are things I'd like to add, but might not be included in ``v1``. If not, they'll most likely constitute one or more minor version increments.
